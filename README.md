I chose to do **Option B** and make my own app for Assignment B3. For Assignment B4, I chose **Option C** and updated the Shiny app I made previously. 

My app uses data that was published by [QS](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2022). I downloaded the CSV file from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasertk/qs-world-university-rankings-2021?select=QS+World+University+Rankings+2022.csv). This app allows people to search for schools based on rankings and location. The default is to filter schools globally by ranking. If "Also filter by country is checked", users can select a country of interest from the dropdown menu. Plots and table show details for selected schools.
