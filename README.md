# Shiny App for STAT 545B

Link to my Shiny app: https://cathy37.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3-cathy-y/

I chose to do **Option B** and make my own app.

My app uses data that was published by [QS](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2022). I downloaded the CSV file from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasertk/qs-world-university-rankings-2021?select=QS+World+University+Rankings+2022.csv). This app allows people to filter for schools based on rankings. Then, they can see a graph of where the schools are located as well as a table containing school details.
